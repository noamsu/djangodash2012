Comminator
==============

Comminator is social site for submitting topics, links -- anything, really -- and have other users comment on it. Comments with a lot of votes quickly rise to the top. Users can vote on comments submitted by other users, and, if they like certain comments a lot, follow their author. Following another user is the best way to stay up to date on their submissions. Users can see the feed composed of threads submitted by those they follow by sorting their home page with the "Personalized" option. Users can follow other users by clicking the "Follow" button on their profile page.


Quick list of things to do when using Comminator:


Login with Facebook! (purely optional, Comminator supports native logins)

Sort your feed by any of options (Personalized, Recent, Most Comments)
